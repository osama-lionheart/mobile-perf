This way, we still receive the affiliate money even if they have forgotten to shop via our site (which is a major problem) which we can then share with the user.\n\nFor information the system would need to be able to tie into our existing Drupal 7 website. However, please note we do have expert Drupal/PHP developers so might only need someone that can develop the plugin, which we can then integrate.",
