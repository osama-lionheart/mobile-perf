It would also be nice to see some sort of counter on the next button that shows you where you are in the city menu.

        "description": "Are you able to design and program a pretty and functional application in JavaScript?\r\n\r\nWe require an application that will run in all browsers, and also in mobile phones. Ideally it will have a responsive design to ensure it works well on mobile phones. \r\n\r\nThe application will identify the bulbs used in a specific car, and will display the bulbs in a visual interface. The application will then present easy-to-click links to an e-commerce site which sells the bulbs.\r\n\r\nThe application will interface with an API providing results in a JSON format, and based on the results the application will take one of several paths to display the result.\r\n\r\nInitially, the application will request a number plate from the visitor, alternatively a list of options will be provided and the visitor must navigate drop-down menus until they select their car model.\r\n\r\nWhen submitting a number plate, one of several responses will be presented:\r\n\r\n- A unique bulb combination has been identified, and the bulbs can be displayed.\r\n- A unique bulb combination has been identified, yet there are minor variations and the visitor must clarify what combination they have. This will be presented through drop-down choices.\r\n- There may be two or more combinations, and the visitor must select between 2 or more car models of similar type using drop-downs.\r\n\r\nThe bulb results fall into 3 different categories: LED, halogen or xenon. The visitor should be presented with an easy way to distinguish between the different types so they can easily make their choice.\r\n\r\nTo see a similar application, visit http://www.autobulbsdirect.co.uk/citroen-xsara-picasso-mpv-2001-y\r\n\r\nHere you can type in a UK license plate, or alternatively navigate a drop-down list of models, types and year group. When a car has been identified, a list of bulbs are available. This gives a good indication of how this will work, although our system will be slightly different.\r\n\r\nYou will need to come up with original graphics and look and feel based on our own website which is http://www.ekstralys.no/\r\n\r\nWe are currently creating an API which will present the results. When you are awarded the project we would expect you to start work immediately on the user interface and provide mockups. When approved and the API is completed you will need to start working immediately to produce the final result.\r\n\r\nIn order to be considered you must already have experience with this kind of work. Key technologies are: UI design, graphics, JavaScript, jQuery and Ajax calls.\r\n\r\nIn your bid, please provide links to JavaScript applications and to user interface designs you have made together with a realistic timescale and bid for this project. Companies with a multi-skilled team will be preferred.\r\n\r\nPlease provide a complete price, including all sensible revisions to ensure the system is fully working according to specifications and UI design.",

This way, we still receive the affiliate money even if they have forgotten to shop via our site (which is a major problem) which we can then share with the user.\r\n\r\nFor information the system would need to be able to tie into our existing Drupal 7 website. However, please note we do have expert Drupal/PHP developers so might only need someone that can develop the plugin, which we can then integrate.",
