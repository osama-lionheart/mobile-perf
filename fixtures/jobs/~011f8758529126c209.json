	"description": "Program to be modified:\nI have an .html program I use interactively every day on the web at: \nhttp://www.maxton.com/temp/03172014odesk.html\n\nIt only works properly with a very limited list of cities. Essentially, one page long or less. \n\nI want to run more cities at one time but have run into a screen problem. The best way to see this is to run the program from the above link. The problem that needs fixing is obvious after you hit the \"next\" key at the bottom left side of the page. If the problem is not readily apparent then you are the wrong person for the job.\n\nRestrictions:\nI am not going to change to a different platform or non-web based software.\nThis .html file uses some javascript commands and html code. It is what it is.\nIf you need to ask me what programming language it is, please do not contact me. \n\nThe city menu on the left side of the screen needs to work properly with the results screen. This can be accomplished if the city menu scrolls or advances independently of the results screen. It would also be nice to see some sort of counter on the next button that shows you where you are in the city menu. Or maybe the city being checked could be highlighted.\n\nAnywhere, I've taken this program as far as I can and need help to advance it further. This will be ongoing as I see the need for modifying this program over time.",
