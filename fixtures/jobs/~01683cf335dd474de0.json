	"description": "Hi There\n\nWe're looking for someone who's worked with Parallax before to make some tweaks to an existing site to get the speed of the slides working slower and also ensure they don't overlay.\n\nWe also need you to ensure the site works across all browsers and sizes. You'll advise us on the best size for the background images so they work on larger browsers and ensure the copy resizes to fit on 1024 x 768.\n\nWe'll supply the details properly to candidates who have good parallax html 5 animation and javascript skills only so please only apply if you have a very high standard in these areas.",
